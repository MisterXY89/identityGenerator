# Identity Generator
## Idea
**WORK IN PROGRESS**
Generate a random and plausible identity, currently German identities only.
The identity can be exported as `.json` file or directly used as a `python dictionary`.

## Disclaimer
The project and the corresponding source code serve solely for the interest and illustration of the technical possibilities.
I assume no liability for any detrimental usage of the source code. The mere presence/publication of this code on my GitHub
account does not imply that I encourage to use these identities in any non-appropriate or non-legal way.
